# Vital-Monitor-System

This project is based on a real-life scenario. In a hospital, there will be a
number of patients whose vitals (things like heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) should be
monitored. Each patient would be connected to a vital monitor and these monitors will
transmit the vital information over a network to a central location. That way nursing staff
will be able to monitor many patients and do it remotely â€“ which is useful when the
patients are contagious.


There will be a set of vital monitors running. Each of these vital
monitors will have an IP address. These vital monitors will be running on a server. Vital
monitors will broadcast their identity to a specific UDP port in the following format:
<ip_addr, port, monitor_id>.
